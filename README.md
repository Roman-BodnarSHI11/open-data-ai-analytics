This project analyzes delivery location data to optimize logistics while applying DevOps practices (Git, CI/CD via GitHub/GitLab Actions, Docker, Kubernetes) learned in the "Development Environment and Components in Data Modeling and Analysis" course .

## Мета

Build an automated, containerized data analysis pipeline using modern DevOps tools to extract actionable logistical insights.


## Questions & hypotheses

1. Which locations on the list have the highest order density and are the most profitable?

2. How do delivery efficiency metrics (time and cost) vary by region or city?

3. Are there noticeable trends in demand for certain delivery locations over time?
